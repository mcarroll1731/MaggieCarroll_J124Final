Analyzing data about salaries based on degrees, college types, and college regions. 

## Question 1: Which are the top 5 paying majors? What are the 5 lowest paying majors? (Using average of starting and mid-career salary)
|  Highest Paying  |  Average Salary  |  Lowest Paying  |  Average Salary  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chemical Engineering | $85,100.00 | Religion | $43,050.00 |
| Computer Engineering | $83,200.00 | Education | $43,450.00 |
| Physician Assistant | $83,000.00 | Spanish | $43,550.00 |
| Electrical Engineer | $81,950.00 | Interior Design | $44,650.00 |
| Aerospace Engineer | $79,350.00 | Music | $45,450.00 |

### How I solved this:
1. In the "Degree that pay back" sheet, make a new column called "AVERAGE_SALARY"
2. Find the average of "Starting Median Salary" and "Mid-Career Median Salary" - AVERAGE(B2, C2) and apply to column
3. Sort from highest to lowest to find the top-paying majors
4. Sort from lowest to highest to find the lowest-paying majors
